      <p>Hi,</p>
      <p>
        My name is Efren Gonzalez.Currently, I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer
        Graduate from Kenzie Academy(SNHU) on October 30th 2021. I have proven
        experience of working with Javascript, React.js, NODE, Express. I also
        have proven experience working with OOP languages such as python and C++
        and their frameworks (Django and .Net). I have worked with databases
        such as Mongoose DB and SQL. I’m a Coach for Kenzie Learners. I've been
        working with coding for some years. Love working with any framework and
        language
      </p>
      <p>
        I am very proud of a project that me and a small team of developers
        created; a one-page e-commerce website called 'Second Chapter' which
        specializes in resale of educational books using react.js for the
        front-end. My role in this project was that of the Scrum Master as well
        as had a huge part in developing the back-end database for our website
        using Node.js, Express and Mongoose/MongoDB.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love debugging and finding solutions for challenges. I find myself
        reading documentation for any technology I’m using constantly. Not
        afraid to learn even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated with an B.S. in Chemistry from Lehman College in 2012 and
        also have a full -stack software engineer certificate from
        Kenzie-Academy.{" "}

        creating, researching or working on personal software projects, I go for
        a run or watch movies or anime.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m looking for a position in a company as a Software Engineer in which
        I can use my great coding and problem solving skills and previous
        experiences to benefit a company that can in return let me make an
        impact in this new field and offer great benefits. If you’re looking for
