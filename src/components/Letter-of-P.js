      <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>
      <p>
        My name is Efren Gonzalez. I am a former Corporal of Marines in the US
        Marine Corps (Oorah!) protecting my country for 8 years. I have over 5
        years of experience as a manager in the retail industry. I graduated
        with an A.S. in Chemistry from CUNY Bronx Community College Campus in
        2012. When I’m not creating, researching or practicing my computers
        skills, I'm lifting weights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am a Full Stack Software Engineer (front and back -end)
        student at Kenzie Academy graduating in October 30th 2021. At Kenzie
        Academy I was able to learn and get really comfortable working with
        Javascript, React library, NODE, Express on the front-end side. I also
        am very comfortable with the Python programming language, Django and
        even have some Mongoose DB knowledge for the back-end side. I am most
        proud of a project that me and a small team of developers created; a
        one-page e-commerce web-app called "Second Chapter" which specializes in
        resale of educational books. My role in this project was that of the
        Scrum Master, assigning tasks and tickets to others as well as had a
        huge part in developing the back-end database for our web-app using
        Mongoose/MongoDB.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m looking for a position in a company as a Software Engineer in which
        I can use my new learned skills and previous experiences to benefit a
        company that can in return give me an opportunity to make an impact in
        the company and great benefits.
